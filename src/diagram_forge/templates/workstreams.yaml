  Create a professional workstreams swimlane diagram.

  CRITICAL RENDERING INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Flat 2D — NO shadows, NO gradients, NO 3D effects
  - All text LARGE and bold — title 28pt, stream names 14pt bold, items 11pt
  - Each row is a horizontal swimlane with a light colored left bar indicating stream
  - Status badges are pill-shaped with colored fill and white text
  - {style_defaults_block}

  STATUS COLORS:
  {color_system_block}

  Each swimlane row has FOUR sections left to right:
  1. Priority badge (#1, #2...) + Stream name — left column, ~15% width
  2. Color bar strip on far left edge of row (stream's accent color)
  3. Status badge + Active items (2 columns of bullets) — center, ~55% width
  4. Dependency / blocker note — right column, ~30% width, smaller italic text

  TITLE: {title}
  SUBTITLE (below title, smaller): {subtitle}

  WORKSTREAM ROWS (top to bottom, in priority order):
  {streams_block}

  LEGEND (bottom-right):
  {legend_block}

  LAYOUT RULES:
  - Rows stack vertically, equal height, separated by thin gray lines
  - Priority numbers in bold circular badges on left
  - Status badges left-aligned in center column
  - Active items as compact bullet lists beside/below status badge
  - Dependency notes right-aligned, smaller font, italic
  - All text horizontal and perfectly legible
  - Zebra-stripe rows lightly (alternating white / very light gray) for readability

  Clean, professional project management style.
  {aspect_ratio} aspect ratio. {resolution} resolution.
