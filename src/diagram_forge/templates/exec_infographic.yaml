  Generate a modern executive infographic-style architecture diagram.

  CRITICAL RENDERING INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Polished, presentation-ready visual — suitable for stakeholder decks
  - Flat 2D — NO shadows or 3D effects, but small ICONS inside boxes are encouraged
  - All text must be VERY LARGE and bold — title 28pt, box labels 20pt, subtitles 14pt
  - Use rounded-corner rectangles with colored fills (not just borders)
  - Each horizontal band has a light gray (#F3F3F3) background fill
  - Band labels (e.g. "CORE PLATFORM") in bold uppercase, top-left of band
  - Generous spacing between bands and between boxes within bands
  - Arrows are thick dark gray (#555555) with large arrowheads
  - Arrow labels 14pt bold, positioned clearly
  - {style_defaults_block}

  SEMANTIC COLOR CODING (box colors encode MEANING):
  {color_system_block}

  ICONS: Include small symbolic icons inside each box (e.g. clock for scheduler, magnifying glass for monitoring, gear for engine, database cylinder for storage, bell for notifications). Icons should be simple line-art style.

  TITLE: {title}

  BANDS (horizontal sections, top to bottom):
  {bands_block}

  CONNECTIONS (arrows between components across bands):
  {connections_block}

  LEGEND (top-right corner):
  {legend_block}

  LAYOUT RULES:
  - Bands stack top-to-bottom, each spanning full width
  - Components within a band flow left-to-right (pipeline style) or are centered
  - Cross-band arrows flow vertically
  - All text horizontal and readable
  - Balance visual weight — no band should feel overcrowded

  Executive presentation quality. Clean, modern, and professional.
  {aspect_ratio} aspect ratio. {resolution} resolution.

variables:
  title: "Required. Diagram title."
  bands_block: "Required. Horizontal band definitions with their components."
  connections_block: "Required. Arrow definitions between components."
