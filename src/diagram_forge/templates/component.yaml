  Create a detailed component diagram showing internal structure and interfaces.

  CRITICAL RENDERING INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Flat 2D technical diagram — NO shadows, NO gradients, NO 3D effects
  - All text must be LARGE, bold, sans-serif — title 24pt, labels 18pt, subtitles 12pt
  - Use rounded-corner rectangles for all boxes
  - The main component is a large dashed boundary box containing internal modules
  - External interfaces shown as small boxes on the boundary edge
  - Dependencies shown outside the main boundary
  - Generous whitespace between elements
  - All arrows dark gray (#555555) with clear arrowheads
  - {style_defaults_block}

  COLOR SYSTEM:
  {color_system_block}

  TITLE: {title}

  EXTERNAL INTERFACES (shown on the boundary edge):
  {interfaces_block}

  INTERNAL MODULES (inside the main boundary):
  {modules_block}

  EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES (outside the boundary):
  {dependencies_block}

  LEGEND (bottom-right):
  {legend_block}

  LAYOUT RULES:
  - Main component boundary is a large dashed rectangle in the center
  - Interfaces on the edges of the boundary (top for inputs, bottom for outputs)
  - Internal modules arranged in logical groups within the boundary
  - Dependencies placed outside the boundary, connected by arrows
  - All text horizontal and readable

  All text crystal clear and perfectly legible. Clean technical diagram.
  {aspect_ratio} aspect ratio. {resolution} resolution.

variables:
