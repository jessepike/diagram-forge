  Create a professional Kanban board diagram.

  CRITICAL RENDERING INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Flat 2D — NO shadows, NO gradients, NO 3D effects
  - All text LARGE — title 24pt bold, column headers 16pt bold uppercase, card titles 13pt bold, subtitles 10pt
  - Three equal-width columns side by side
  - Column headers are colored bands at top of each column with item count badge
  - Cards are white rounded rectangles with a colored LEFT BORDER (4px) indicating category
  - Cards have subtle 1px gray outer border
  - {style_defaults_block}

  COLUMN COLORS:
  {color_system_block}

  Each card contains:
  - Card title (bold, 13pt)
  - Subtitle / description (smaller, 10pt, gray)
  - Colored left border (4px) for category

  TITLE: {title}
  SUBTITLE (below title, smaller italic): {subtitle}

  COLUMN 1 — TO DO:
  Header: light gray (#F1F5F9), label "TO DO" with count badge
  {todo_block}

  COLUMN 2 — IN PROGRESS:
  Header: light blue (#DBEAFE), label "IN PROGRESS" with count badge
  {in_progress_block}

  COLUMN 3 — DONE:
  Header: light green (#DCFCE7), label "DONE" with count badge
  {done_block}

  CATEGORY LEGEND (bottom center):
  Colored dots only (NO hex codes) — one dot per category with label
  {legend_block}

  LAYOUT RULES:
  - Three columns exactly equal width, spanning full diagram width
  - Cards stack vertically within each column with small gap between them
  - Empty columns show centered placeholder text in light gray italic
  - Count badges are small pill shapes beside column header label
  - CRITICAL: Each card appears EXACTLY ONCE — never duplicate any card across columns
  - All text horizontal and perfectly legible
