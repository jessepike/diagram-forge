  Generate a clean, professional C4 Container diagram.

  CRITICAL RENDERING INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Flat 2D technical diagram — NO shadows, NO gradients, NO 3D effects
  - Orthographic view (straight on, not skewed or angled)
  - All text must be LARGE, bold, sans-serif — title 24pt, box labels 18pt, subtitles 12pt
  - Each box must be minimum 160px wide and 70px tall
  - Use rounded-corner rectangles for all boxes
  - Generous whitespace between all elements and rows
  - All arrows dark gray (#555555) with clear arrowheads
  - Arrow labels 12pt, positioned near the middle of the arrow
  - {style_defaults_block}

  C4 COLOR CONVENTIONS (use these exact styles):
  {color_system_block}

  Each box has TWO lines of text:
  - Line 1: Bold label (name of the element)
  - Line 2: Smaller italic subtitle (technology or description)

  TITLE: {title}

  ELEMENTS:
  {elements_block}

  BOUNDARIES (dashed rectangles grouping related elements):
  {boundaries_block}

  RELATIONSHIPS (labeled arrows between elements):
  {relationships_block}

  LEGEND (bottom-right, small box):
  {legend_block}

  LAYOUT RULES:
  - Arrange elements in clear rows, top-to-bottom
  - People/users at the top
  - Internal containers in the middle
  - External systems at the bottom
  - Group related elements within dashed boundary boxes
  - All text horizontal and readable — never rotated
  - Consistent spacing between rows (minimum 40px gap)
  - Arrows should not cross unnecessarily

  All text crystal clear and perfectly legible.
  Clean, minimalist technical diagram. No decorative elements.
  {aspect_ratio} aspect ratio. {resolution} resolution.
