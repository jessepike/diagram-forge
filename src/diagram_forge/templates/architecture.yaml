  Create an enterprise-grade TOGAF-style layered architecture diagram.

  CRITICAL RENDERING INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Flat 2D only — NO shadows, NO gradients, NO 3D effects, NO artistic embellishment
  - All text must be LARGE, bold, sans-serif — title 24pt, labels 18pt, subtitles 14pt
  - Each box must be wide enough to fit its label without wrapping
  - Use generous whitespace between all elements
  - All arrows dark gray (#555555) with clear arrowheads
  - {style_defaults_block}

  COLOR SYSTEM (use exact hex codes):
  {color_system_block}

  Each layer is a horizontal band spanning the full width with its layer color as a light background fill.
  Components within each band are white boxes with colored left borders matching their layer.

  TITLE: {title}

  LAYERS (horizontal bands, top to bottom):
  {layers_block}

  CONNECTIONS (arrows between components):
  {connections_block}

  LEGEND (bottom-right corner, small box):
  {legend_block}

  LAYOUT RULES:
  - Layers stack top-to-bottom as horizontal bands
  - Components within a layer arrange left-to-right
  - Arrows flow top-to-bottom between layers where possible
  - All text horizontal and readable — never rotated or diagonal
  - Maintain consistent spacing between bands

  All text crystal clear and perfectly legible. Enterprise presentation quality.
  Professional, clean design with clear visual hierarchy.
  {aspect_ratio} aspect ratio. {resolution} resolution.

variables:
  title: "Required. Diagram title."
  layers_block: "Required. Layer definitions with components."
  connections_block: "Required. Connection definitions between components."
  legend_block: "Optional. Auto-generated from color_system if not provided."
