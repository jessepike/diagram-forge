  Create a professional brand infographic slide. Warm, premium aesthetic — not clinical or corporate.

  CRITICAL RENDERING INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Background: cream or off-white (#F5F0E8) — NOT white, NOT gray
  - Headline font: serif (Playfair Display, Georgia, or similar) — large, bold, impactful
  - Body font: clean sans-serif (Inter or similar)
  - Organic blob shapes as subtle decorative background elements — soft, partially off-screen
  - Flat 2D — NO harsh shadows, but soft depth is acceptable
  - Colors: warm and purposeful — use brand palette, avoid clinical blues or corporate grays
  - Icons: simple, line-art style, consistent with brand warmth
