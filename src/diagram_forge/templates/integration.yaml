  Create a system integration map showing connections between systems.

  CRITICAL RENDERING INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Flat 2D technical diagram — NO shadows, NO gradients, NO 3D effects
  - All text must be LARGE, bold, sans-serif — title 24pt, system labels 18pt, protocol labels 12pt
  - Each system is a rounded-corner rectangle with name and subtitle
  - Connections are labeled arrows showing protocol/data format
  - Domain boundaries shown as dashed rectangles grouping related systems
  - Generous whitespace between systems
  - All arrows dark gray (#555555) with clear arrowheads
  - Line styles indicate protocol: solid=REST/sync, dashed=async/events, dotted=batch
  - {style_defaults_block}

  COLOR SYSTEM:
  {color_system_block}

  TITLE: {title}

  SYSTEMS:
  {systems_block}

  INTEGRATIONS (connections between systems):
  {integrations_block}

  PROTOCOLS AND DATA FORMATS:
  {protocols_block}

  LEGEND (bottom-right):
  {legend_block}

  LAYOUT RULES:
  - Group systems by domain within dashed boundary boxes
  - Internal systems in the center, external on the periphery
  - Middleware/integration layers between internal and external
  - Label all connections with protocol, format, and frequency
  - Bidirectional connections shown with double-headed arrows
  - All text horizontal and readable

  All text crystal clear and perfectly legible. Clean technical diagram.
  {aspect_ratio} aspect ratio. {resolution} resolution.

variables:
  title: "Required. Integration map title."
